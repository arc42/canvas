>A _Canvas_ in our sense is a structured framework that facilitates the analysis, visualization and communication of key elements.

## The Origin: Business Model Canvas

The idea of using a canvas to analyse and visualize originated in the groundbreaking book "[Business Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/team/alexander-osterwalder)" by Alex Osterwalder and his colleagues.

The invented the idea of providing pre-structured _areas_ to develop and communicate business models.

Their book with the canvas-approach was an incredible success, with several millions copies sold. 

One reason in our opinion was the reduction to an absolute minimum of information. 
The canvas simply does not leave room for extensive verbose documentation.
Canvas users have to focus on the important stuff.

## The Canvas-Evolution

Numerous other groups and disciplines created canvases for their own domain or purpose.
Below you find a (non-exhaustive) overview of some approaches we consider useful:

* [Product Canvas](https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/the-product-canvas/) by Roman Pichler
* [Lean Canvas](https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas) by Ash Maurya
* [Lean UX Canvas (v2)](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/leanuxcanvas-v2/)
* [Bounded Context Canvas](https://github.com/ddd-crew/bounded-context-canvas) by the awesome [DDD-Crew](https://github.com/ddd-crew)
* [Context Canvas](https://re-magazine.ireb.org/articles/the-context-canvas) to improve Requirements Engineering, by [IREB](https://www.ireb.org)
* [Customer Journey Canvas](https://www.designabetterbusiness.tools/tools/customer-journey-canvas) helps to see how a customer experiences a problem
* [Wardley-Mapping Canvas](https://miro.com/blog/wardley-maps-whiteboard-canvas/) helps teams create a Wardley Map, making _strategy_ a collaborative endavour, allowing technical and business leaders to cooperate on a joint model.


## Canvas in Software Architecture

Patrick (one of the [contributors](/contributors) of this page) was the first to describe a canvas for software architecture. 
His original work (now called _architecture inception canvas_) was influenced mainly by projects creating new systems from scratch - and therefore needed a strong focus on _requirements_.

Gernot (the second contributor to this page) took a slightly different approach: 
He needed an approach to document legacy systems with a minimal effort - which resultet in the _architecture communication canvas_.

Both architecture canvas approaches have been applied to several real-world systems - which are not open-source, and therefore cannot be disclosed in original here!
